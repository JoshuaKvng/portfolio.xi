        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
        <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>

        <header>History of HTML</header>         
        <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN. The initial version of HTML was not officially released but was used to share documents among researchers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1989:</b> Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at CERN, proposed the idea of the World Wide Web. He envisioned a system for sharing documents over the internet.</li>
            <li><b>1990:</b> Berners-Lee developed the first web browser and server software, and created the first HTML document.</li>
            <li><b>1993:</b> HTML 1.0 was released, allowing users to create simple web pages.</li>
            <li><b>1995:</b> HTML 2.0 was published, adding more features and becoming the standard markup language for web design.</li>
            <li><b>1997:</b> HTML 3.2 introduced new features, but some were slow to be adopted due to browser limitations.</li>
            <li><b>1999:</b> HTML 4.01 was released, offering more powerful features and becoming widely used.</li>
            <li><b>2012:</b> HTML5 was published, extending HTML 4.01 and adding support for multimedia elements like video and audio.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>HTML has evolved significantly over the years, enabling the creation of rich, interactive web pages. It continues to be a fundamental technology for web development.</p>

            <p><b>November 24, 1995</b><br/>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>

            <h4>HTML 3</h4>
            <p><b>January 14, 1997</b><br/>HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.</p>
            <p>Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>December 18, 1997</b><br/>HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
                <ul>
                  <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
                  <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
                  <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
                  <li>Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>April 24, 1998</b><br> HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</li>
              <li><b>December 24, 1999</b><br/>HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.</li>
              <li><b>May 2000</b><br>ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.

          <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of a web page and its content by using a series of elements. Each element is represented by a tag, which tells the browser how to display the content enclosed within it. <br/> A simple HTML document consists of the following essential elements:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML. It helps browsers display web pages correctly.</li>
            <li>&lt;html&gt;: This is the root element of an HTML page. It wraps all the content on the entire page.</li>
            <li>&lt;head&gt;: This element contains meta-information about the HTML page, such as its title and character set.</li>

        <div id="HTML_Tags">
          <h4>What are HTML Tags</h4>
          <p>HTML tags are the building blocks of web pages. They define the structure and content of a webpage by enclosing different parts of the content with tags that tell the browser how to display them, thereby being the basic building blocks of any website used to create web pages in various formats.</p>
          <p> HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and typically come in pairs, i.e. an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character. The opening tag specifies the beginning of an element, while the closing tag marks the end.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="types">
          <h4>Types of HTML Tags</h4>
          <p>HTML tags are the fundamental elements used to structure and format content on web pages. They provide instructions to web browsers on how to render text, images, links, and other media content. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and typically come in pairs, i.e., an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has the same text as the opening tag but includes an additional forward-slash (/) character. <br/> Types of said tags include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Paired and Unpaired Tags</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Paired Tags: Paired tags consist of an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag specifies the beginning of an element, while the closing tag marks the end. For example:
                  <pre>
                    <code>
                      &lt;p&gt;This text is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                  In this example, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag, and &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag
                </li>
                <li>Unpaired Tags: Unpaired tags, also known as self-closing tags, do not require a closing tag. Examples include:
                    <pre>
                      <code>
                        &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description"/&gt;
                      </code>
                    </pre>
                    <br> In older versions, self-closing tags used a forward slash before the closing angle bracket, like &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description" /&gt;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Formatting Tags</b> <br/> These tags help format text, such as changing the size, font style, or making text bold. Examples include:
              <pre>
                <code>
                  &lt;b&gt;Bold text&lt;/b&gt;
                  &lt;i&gt;Italic text&lt;/i&gt;
                  &lt;u&gt;Underlined text&lt;/u&gt;
                </code>
              </pre>
              Tables, divisions, and span tags also help format a web page or document and set the layout.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Structure Tags</b> <br> Structure tags help create the basic structure of an HTML document. Examples include:
              <pre>
                <code>
                  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                  &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
                    &lt;head&gt;
                      &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
                    &lt;/head&gt;
                    &lt;body&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/body&gt;
                  &lt;/html&gt;
                </code>
              </pre>
              These tags do not affect the formatting of text but assist in creating the basic HTML page from the root.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Control Tags</b> <br/>Control tags manage content or scripts. Examples include form tags, drop-down lists, input text boxes, and script tags. These tags are used to interact with the visitor or user.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="common_tags">Common HTML Tags</h4>
          <p>Here are some common HTML tags and their uses:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;: Headings of different levels.</li>
            <li>&lt;p&gt;: Paragraphs of text.</li>
            <li>&lt;a&gt;: Creates hyperlinks to other web pages or resources.</li>
            <li>&lt;img&gt;: Embeds images into the web page.</li>
            <li>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;: Creates unordered (bullet) and ordered (numbered) lists.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page.</p>

            &lt;!doctype html&gt;
            &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;

                &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
                &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;
              &lt;/head&gt;
              &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;
              &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
           </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;!doctype html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
            <li>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
            <li>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
            <li>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
            <li>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt; — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
            <li>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
            <li>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
